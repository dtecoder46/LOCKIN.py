Before running the program, the user must write their tasks and subtasks in a YAML file. YAML is quite simple. The core of YAML is the key-value pair. You must write your tasks/subtasks in this form. For subtasks, you can indent and add a dash before a key-value pair.

~~~yaml
task1: 3.4 HW
    - task1.1: Do Qs 1-5
    - task 1.2: Do Qs 6-10
    - etc: etc
~~~

Once you are ready, run the program.
